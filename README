A Python+Flask+Peewee RESTful web service platform, using a MySQL db

Intended for use with virtualenv

    virtualenv venv
    pip install Flask
    pip install Flask-peewee

Also, MySQLdb library for python  needs to be installed per os (or just gouge your eyes out with dull pencils on OSX)
Config.py will need to be created for database connection
Next run the following each time you use the app

    . venv/bin/activate
    python main.py

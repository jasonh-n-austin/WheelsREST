An example of a Python+Flask-based RESTful web service, using a sqlLite db

Intended for use with virtualenv

    virtualenv venv
    pip install Flask

Also, MySQLdb needs to be installed per os (or just gouge your eyes out with dull pencils on OSX)

Next run the following each time you use the app

    . venv/bin/activate
    python main.py
